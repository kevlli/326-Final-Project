  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>
    We, ECOmmute, promotes environment friendly methods of transportation. With
    the deprecation of the ozone layer, and rising global temperatures due to
    carbon emissions, ECOmmute aims to both encourage and facilitate cleaner
    methods of transportation.
  </p>
  <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
  <p>
    At its core, ECOmmute is a transportation-based emissions tracker. It tracks
    the carbon emissions of its users based on their daily commute. Users log
    their commute, then the application calculates emissions based on their
    transportation choices. There are features such as a weekly personal log for
    your carbon emissions as well as a leaderboard for lowest carbon emissions
    and resources on alternative methods of transportation such as biking,
    carpooling and public transportation.
    <br />Try it out yourself!
