  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>
    We, ECOmmute, promotes environment
    friendly methods of transportation. With the deprecation of the ozone
    layer, and rising global temperatures due to carbon emissions, ECOmmute
    aims to both encourage and facilitate cleaner methods of transportation.
  </p>
  <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
  <p>
    At its core, ECOmmute is a
    transportation-based emissions tracker. It tracks the carbon emissions
    of its users based on their daily commute. Users log their commute, then
    the application calculates emissions based on their transportation
    choices. There are features such as a weekly leaderboard for lowest
    carbon emissions as well as personalized recommendations for alternative
    methods of transportation such as biking, carpooling and public
    transportation. <a href="/emissions/emissions.html"> Try it out yourself! </a>
