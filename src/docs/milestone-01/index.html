    <section id="overview">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Our project, ECOmmute, is a web application that promotes environment friendly methods of transportation. With the deprecation of the ozone layer, and rising global temperatures due to carbon emissions, ECOmmute aims to both encourage and facilitate cleaner methods of  transportation. Our target audience is anyone who commutes / travels, but more specifically UMass students. At its core, ECOmmute is a transportation-based emissions tracker. It tracks the carbon emissions of its users based on their daily commute. Users log their commute, then the application calculates emissions based on their transportation choices. There are features such as a weekly leaderboard for lowest carbon emissions as well as personalized recommendations for alternative methods of transportation such as biking, carpooling and public transportation. This effectively encourages and promotes alternatives for those who need that extra little bit of motivation.  We can also utilize map based features for public transportation and biking accessible, as well as ridesharing / carpooling. Overall, our project aims to encourage self-awareness in regards to one’s carbon footprint, and be more proactive in fighting against global warming.</p>

        <h2>Application Parts</h2>
        <p>ECOmmute is nothing without its features. One, and likely the most important, of these is the emissions tracker. Specific to each user, whenever a user logs their commute, ECOmmute will automatically calculate their carbon emissions based on the length and method of transportation for that commute. It will then add that number to their cumulative emission total. By encouraging users to log their commutes, this will make users more aware of their carbon footprint and environmental impact.
            <br>Another important feature is the weekly leaderboard for least carbon emissions. Every week, ECOmmute compiles a list of the top 10 users with the least carbon emissions. Throughout the week a user can see their current spot on the leaderboard. Those at the very top will be encouraged to avoid carbon heavy commuting to maintain their spot, while those at the bottom will feel an obligation to do better. This friendly challenge encourages users to limit their output, effectively promoting carbon mindfulness with the help of human competitive nature.
            <br>Additionally, ECOmmute will give personalized recommendations for alternative modes of transportation. This could be based on personal interests (biking), or even geolocational data (near public transportation or bike routes). This could even be expanded to a user-to-user recommendation system, where users share their insight on what others can do to improve their carbon emissions.

    <section id="data-requirements">
        <h2>Data Requirements</h2>
        <p>include an introduction, four main paragraphs detailing the top types of data your application 
            will handle, and a conclusion, making up 400-600 words in total</p>
    </section>

    <section id="wire-frames">
        <h2>Wire Frames</h2>
        <p>you'll include four wireframes representing key views/screens of your application, along with a 
            brief paragraph for each explaining its purpose and design rationale. This section should be 200 
            words in length</p>

        <h2>Real-World Connection</h2>
        <img id="icecap-img" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qHE0n5c6-6g/maxresdefault.jpg">
        <p>As evidenced by the picture above, global temperatures have been on a steady rise for the past century. With it comes many complications in regards to the future state of the world, leading to the question: What can we as individuals do about this?
            <br>ECOmmute is a response to these growing concerns over environmental issues. With rising sea levels worldwide due to melting glaciers, as well as air quality worsening in cities all around, there is an increasing level of panic for individuals who care about the quality of the Earth which we inhabit. Of course, many causes of these issues we cannot directly stop, such as deforestation or corporation-based carbon emissions. However, one thing we can control is our own individual carbon footprint, which ECOmmute hopes to transform into part of one’s daily routine.
            <br>Overall, ECOmmute isn’t trying to singlehandedly solve the global warming crisis that has been haunting humanity for decades. Rather, it is trying to encourage awareness at the individual level, spreading mindfulness in hopes of rallying support for environmental legislation and eliminating the “global warming isn’t real” mindset.
