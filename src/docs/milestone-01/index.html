    <section id="overview">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Our project, ECOmmute, is a web application that promotes environment
        friendly methods of transportation. With the deprecation of the ozone
        layer, and rising global temperatures due to carbon emissions, ECOmmute
        aims to both encourage and facilitate cleaner methods of transportation.
        Our target audience is anyone who commutes / travels, but more
        specifically UMass students. At its core, ECOmmute is a
        transportation-based emissions tracker. It tracks the carbon emissions
        of its users based on their daily commute. Users log their commute, then
        the application calculates emissions based on their transportation
        choices. There are features such as a weekly leaderboard for lowest
        carbon emissions as well as personalized recommendations for alternative
        methods of transportation such as biking, carpooling and public
        transportation. This effectively encourages and promotes alternatives
        for those who need that extra little bit of motivation. We can also
        utilize map based features for public transportation and biking
        accessible, as well as ridesharing / carpooling. Overall, our project
        aims to encourage self-awareness in regards to one’s carbon footprint,
        and be more proactive in fighting against global warming.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="application-parts">
      <h2>Application Parts</h2>
      <p>
        ECOmmute is nothing without its features. One, and likely the most
        important, of these is the emissions tracker. Specific to each user,
        whenever a user logs their commute, ECOmmute will automatically
        calculate their carbon emissions based on the length and method of
        transportation for that commute. It will then add that number to their
        cumulative emission total. By encouraging users to log their commutes,
        this will make users more aware of their carbon footprint and
        environmental impact.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another important feature is the weekly leaderboard for least carbon
        emissions. Every week, ECOmmute compiles a list of the top 10 users with
        the least carbon emissions. Throughout the week a user can see their
        current spot on the leaderboard. Those at the very top will be
        encouraged to avoid carbon heavy commuting to maintain their spot, while
        those at the bottom will feel an obligation to do better. This friendly
        challenge encourages users to limit their output, effectively promoting
        carbon mindfulness with the help of human competitive nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, ECOmmute will give personalized recommendations for
        alternative modes of transportation. This could be based on personal
        interests (biking), or even geolocational data (near public
        transportation or bike routes). This could even be expanded to a
        user-to-user recommendation system, where users share their insight on
        what others can do to improve their carbon emissions.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="data-requirements">
      <h2>Data Requirements</h2>
      <p>
        ECOmmute provides a community for users to present their commute
        progress with each other, in order for users to advocate for
        environmental awareness and promote low-carbon transportation modes with
        the entire world. To facilitate this, user profile information must be
        collected for display in the application. This includes but not limited
        to: username / name, age and birthday, gender, email address, phone
        number, and profile picture. These demographics help each user create
        their own identity inside the application, which contributes to a more
        lively, tightly knit user experience. Some other potential features
        could include a follower system, where users can follow other users to
        easily check in on their recent activities, resulting in an engaging
        network in the community that promotes environmental awareness even
        more.
      </p>
      <p>
        ECOmmute is an web application that could be accessed from a variety of
        devices, therefore in order to maintain a consistent user experience, a
        user authentication system must be implemented. At the time of account
        creation, users also create a password associated with each account.
        This password would then be used to communicate with our application
        server, which verifies the identity of the user, and responds back with
        application data. User authentication could be implemented using the
        bearer token method, where a token is included in every response from
        the server at the time of login, which is used to authenticate every
        action made by the user. There are many ways to implement this method,
        which includes OAuth and JSON Web Tokens (JWT), and kept track using
        local or session storage. Another method of authentication is using
        cookies, which is a similar concept but the web browser automatically
        includes the cookies for each request from the user. This allows for a
        smoother developer experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main data handled by ECOmmute is the commute logs, which ties to the
        main functionality of the application. These logs are made by the users
        inside our application, and includes information about the commute, such
        as mode of transportation (walk, bike, scooter, bus, train, carpool,
        etc.), start and finish location/time, and additional comments about the
        commute. These data would be sent to our server, which calculates the
        approximate carbon emission of the commute, and updates the respective
        user’s total carbon footprint and activities, which then notifies
        related users about the commute log. This is the key component of the
        application, therefore these data should be treated carefully and
        measured as accurately as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        The user’s geographical location would also be used in ECOmmute. For
        each log we receive the location data of the commute of the user. The
        database takes note of this, and collects statistics on what kind of
        transportation mode is popular for an area. While the user is active on
        our application, we track their geographical location and make
        suggestions based on it. There are many potential possibilities for this
        recommendation system, which could take into account external
        information such as weather and public transport schedule, using their
        respective APIs.
      </p>
      <p>
        In summary, the overall functionality of ECOmmute depends heavily on
        these data in order to promote an active community of eco-friendly
        commutes. These data are collected from users as well as external APIs,
        and the integration of these types of data creates a seamless user
        experience that encourages users to be aware of carbon emissions.

    <section id="wire-frames">
      <h2>Wire Frames</h2>
      <p>
        The wireframes for ECOmmute have been designed to present the
        transportation statistics with a simple UI to filter data. The homepage
        highlights the website's main applications. This will include the
        emissions tracker, weekly leaderboard, and recommendations for
        alternative methods of transportation.
      </p>
      <img src="imgs/wireframe-homepage.jpg" alt="homepage" >
      <p>
        Next, the emissions chart will present data that can be arranged by
        vehicle type, fuel type, and distance traveled. It will take into
        account communal travel and will show the carbon emissions per person
        based on the search filter.
      </p>
      <img src="imgs/wireframe-emissions.jpg" alt="emissions" >
      <p>
        Next, the travel planner will allow users to input their current
        location and desired destination. It will also allow the user to input
        their methods of transportation. It will then compare the carbon
        emissions, also showing the total time of the trip. Additionally, it
        will also show potential community transportation options.
      </p>
      <img src="imgs/wireframe-travelplanner.jpg" alt="travelplanner">
      <p>
        Lastly, the final wireframe will be a resources page. This will provide
        information on what carbon emissions are and how they affect the
        environment. It will also show how to reduce carbon emissions, such as
        providing options for communal transportation based on your location.
        This wireframe will also provide outside resources in case anyone wants
        to learn more about the topics relating to ECOmmute.

        As evidenced by the picture above, global temperatures have been on a
        steady rise for the past century. With it comes many complications in
        regards to the future state of the world, leading to the question: What
        can we as individuals do about this?
      </p>
      <p>
        ECOmmute is a response to these growing concerns over environmental
        issues. With rising sea levels worldwide due to melting glaciers, as
        well as air quality worsening in cities all around, there is an
        increasing level of panic for individuals who care about the quality of
        the Earth which we inhabit. Of course, many causes of these issues we
        cannot directly stop, such as deforestation or corporation-based carbon
        emissions. However, one thing we can control is our own individual
        carbon footprint, which ECOmmute hopes to transform into part of one’s
        daily routine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, ECOmmute isn’t trying to singlehandedly solve the global
        warming crisis that has been haunting humanity for decades. Rather, it
        is trying to encourage awareness at the individual level, spreading
        mindfulness in hopes of rallying support for environmental legislation
        and eliminating the “global warming isn’t real” mindset.

    <section id="integrative-experience">
      <h2>Integrative Experience</h2>
      <p>
        The creation of ECOmmute combines the skills and knowledge from the
        different fields of study and aligns well with the main criteria of the
        Integrative Experience requirements. Developing ECOmmute allows us to
        reflect as a group on information we learned in our early years as
        undergraduate students and apply it towards finding a solution to a
        complex, major issue that affects all of us. This project ties in
        coursework from domains like environmental science, data analytics, user
        experience, and web development. It also incorporates our personal
        interests in sustainability and technology. The foundation of ECOmmute
        depends on prior knowledge of carbon emissions, the effect of them on
        the environment, and how to examine carbon emission data to give
        recommendations for strategies to reduce one’s carbon footprint. Through
        the development of this project, we will work together and combine our
        different skills and knowledge gained through our diverse experiences
        and previous studies to create an application to help users understand
        and work towards reducing their carbon emissions. One of the Integrative
        Experience criteria involves the application of knowledge learned in
        General Education courses to solve new real-world problems, and this
        project embodies exactly that. We will be connecting our prior knowledge
        with web programming to make strides towards solving the real-world
        problem of climate change.
